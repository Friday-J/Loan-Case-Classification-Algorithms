# Loan-Case-Classification-Algorithms
This project builds classifier algorithms to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not, using a historical dataset from previous loan applications. The algorithms used include: 

k-Nearest Neighbour

Decision Tree

Support Vector Machine

Logistic Regression

The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

Jaccard index

F1-score

LogLoss
