# Loan-Case-Classification-Algorithms
This project builds classifier algorithms to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not, using a historical dataset from previous loan applications. The algorithms used include: K-Nearest Neighbors,  Decision Tree,  Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression. The following metrics were used to measure the performance of each model:  Jaccard index,  F1-score  LogLoss
